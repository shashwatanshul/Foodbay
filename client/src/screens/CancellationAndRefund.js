      <p>
        SHASHWAT SINGH believes in helping its customers as far as possible and
        has therefore adopted a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 7
          days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not
          be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
          vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
          them.
        </li>
        <li>
          SHASHWAT SINGH does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
          items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund or replacement
          can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the
          product delivered is not good.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the
          same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
          entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
          their end. This should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the
          products.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or
          as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our
          customer service within 7 days of receiving the product. The Customer
          Service Team, after reviewing your complaint, will take an appropriate
          decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          For complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
          manufacturers, please refer the issue to the manufacturer.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of any refunds approved by SHASHWAT SINGH, it will take 5-7
          days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
