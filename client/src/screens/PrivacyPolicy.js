      <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
      <h3>How do you get my consent?</h3>
      <p>
        When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction,
        verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or
        return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and
        using it for that specific reason only.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
        marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or
        provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I withdraw my consent?</h3>
      <p>
        If after opting in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent

      <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>

      <h3>SECTION 4 - PAYMENT</h3>
      <p>
        We use Razorpay for processing payments. We and Razorpay do not store
        your card data on our servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment.

        complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your
        purchase transaction information is not saved.

        Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
        by the PCI Security Standards Council, a joint effort of brands like
        Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.

        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways
        and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy
        policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to
        them for your purchase-related transactions.
      </p>
